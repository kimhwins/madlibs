			<p>Once upon a time, a <span id="adjective-1"></span> girl named <span class="capitalize" id="girlsname-1"></span> was born into the Land of <span class="capitalize" id="sillyword"></span>. <br><br>

				Although no one knew it, she was not a normal <span id="noun-1"></span> -- she was magically <span id="adjective-extra-ripme"></span>. But as they say, with great power comes great <span id="pluralnoun-1"></span>. So as she grew up, she was faced with many challenges. <br><br>

				When she was only <span id="number-1"></span>, she was alone in <span id="location-1"></span> when a flock of <span id="adjective-2"></span> three-<span id="bodypart-1"></span>-ed <span id="pluralanimal-1"></span> appeared out of nowhere! She had to <span id="adverb-1"></span> <span id="verb-1"></span> them, until their <span id="pluralbodypart-1"></span> were <span id="adjective-3"></span>! Luckily, she got away with only <span id="noun-2"></span> on her <span id="bodypart-2"></span>. <br><br>

				A year later, she got a call on her <span id="noun-3"></span> from her friend, <span id="adjective-4"></span> <span class="capitalize" id="boysname-1"></span>. He was <span id="emotion-1"></span>, telling her of an evil that was trying to <span id="verb-2"></span> the Legendary <span class="capitalize" id="noun-4"></span>. Together, they protected it from evil by <span id="verbing-1"></span> the evil <span id="adverb-3"></span> <span id="number-3"></span> times. <br> <br>

				In the years afterwards, <span class="capitalize" id="girlsname-2"></span> became known for her skill in <span id="verbing-2"></span>. <br><br>

				Finally, when she was <span id="number-2"></span> years old, her <span id="adjective-5"></span> powers were truly put to the test. She received a letter from the leader of the <span class="capitalize" id="adjective-6"></span> <span class="capitalize" id="noun-5"></span> Association, explaining that she had been chosen to complete a very <span id="adjective-7"></span> and important quest. If she failed, the world would <span id="verb-3"></span> <span id="adverb-2"></span>. Being the <span id="adjective-8"></span>, <span id="adjective-9"></span> girl that she was, <span class="capitalize" id="girlsname-3"></span> took up the task, joined by her <span id="adjective-extra2"></span> pet <span id="animal-1"></span> <span class="capitalize" id="name-1"></span>, who carried along her magical, <span id="adjective-10"></span> armor. Together they followed a map into the <span id="adjective-extra3"></span> <span class="capitalize" id="sillyword-2"></span> Cave. There, they found a <span id="adjective-11"></span> <span id="creature-1"></span>. The battle was long and monstrous, but in the end, <span class="capitalize" id="girlsname-4"></span> and <span class="capitalize" id="name-2"></span> <span id="adjective-12"></span> <span id="pasttenseverb-1"></span> <span id="pluralnoun-2"></span> at the creature. It <span id="pasttenseverb-2"></span> in pain, and then the battle was over. They had <span id="pasttenseverb-3"></span> the world. <br><br>
